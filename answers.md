- **1b.**

The running times of the sorting algorithms generally align with their asymptotic bounds. Quicksort with a fixed pivot performs well on random inputs(O n log n) but degrades to O(n^2) on sorted inputs, while the random pivot version is efficient across both input types by avoiding worst-case scenarios. However, selection sort is always O(n^2). 



- **1c.**
Compared to the fastest implementation, quicksort with a random pivot, Timsort performs about equal. But with already sorted input, Timsort performs better at O(n).
